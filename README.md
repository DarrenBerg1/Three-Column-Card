## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project I focused mostly on learning more about implementing grid and media queries for responsive websites. I have been mostly focusing on and implementing flexbox, so seeing this three card layout. I felt it would be more optimal to implement grid and give me an opportunity to learn.

### Continued development

I will continue to study and implement grid and media queries into my upcoming projects to continue to get muscle memory and drill it home.
